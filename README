Veex RMI is an attempt to provide a Java RMI application (a server and a sample client) to execute commands on a remote machine and serving the output of the commands run to the client.

The application doesn't focus on security (at the time writting), but it will in the future. 

Note that this project is just a proof of concept, and the Veex RMI server, along with an Eclipse plug-in are being developed here:
